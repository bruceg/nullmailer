To build and install nullmailer, run:

	sh autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install install-root

(Running autogen.sh is optional for release packages)

To enable SSL/TLS support, add "--enable-tls" to the configure command
line above.

The default installation expects that a user and group "nullmail" have
already been set up.  The install steps will create all appropriate
configuration and queue directories, and change their ownership as needed.

You may set the installation directory and other parameters by options
to ./configure.  To see them, run:

	./configure --help
