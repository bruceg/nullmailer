1999-02-16  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	itoa only once per constructor, and to avoid calling time() and
	getpid() more than necessary.

	* src/send.cc (exec_protocol): Stripped out the error messages
	printed in this routine, since they go nowhere anyways.
	(send_one): Added tracing information about program execution.

	* src/makefield.cc (make_messageid): Can't have two calls to itoa
	as arguments to the same function call (mystring constructor in
	this case) because itoa uses a static buffer.

	SBIN_DIR.

	* lib/defines.h: Added a definition for SBIN_DIR.

1999-02-15  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	the lines that are read in, to ignore lines that start with a
	pound ('#') or are empty, and to return false if no lines were
	read.

	* lib/config_read.cc (config_read): Modified to strip the
	resulting string.

	* lib/mystring.cc: Revised lstrip, rstrip, and strip to return
	*this if no modifications to the string were necessary.

	always load all the config files, and moved the loading of the
	remotes into a separate section.
	(load_remotes): Added support for loading "hostname protocol"
	pairs from the remotes file.

	* protocols/smtp.cc (main): Filename is argv[2], not argv[1].

	error code from the exit status of the program.  Also implemented
	a configurable pause between queue runs.

	expects the hostname as the first command-line parameter and the
