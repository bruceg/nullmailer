This file lists all the major user-visible changes to nullmailer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.40

- Fixed some compile problems to allow nullmailer to compile on FreeBSD.

- Fixed a bug in the sendmail emulator to allow it to set the sender
  name and address from the command line properly.

- Modified the CLI library to behave more like the standard getopt
  library.

- Made a change to protocol between nullmailer-send and protocol
  modules.  nullmailer-send now opens up the message files and passes
  them to the protocol module as FD 0 instead of passing a filename.

- Added some notes to the nullmailer-send manual page explaining how
  messages are delivered.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.39

- Fixed problems in nullmailer-send in parsing the "remotes" file.  It
  previously did not handle comment lines or tabs or multiple white
  space.

- Made nullmailer-inject stricter about header lines to ensure that they
  comply with RFC822.

- Several minor updates to the libraries to bring them up to date.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.38

- Fixed bug in nullmailer-send that caused it to refuse to send mail
  when the optional "pausetime" configuration file did not exist.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.37

- Fixed bug in address parser that caused strings like "<a@b.c>"
  (without a leading comment) to fail.

- Make nullmailer-send rescan the mail queue each time it wakes up,
  rather than only if the timestamp changes to avoids race conditions.

- Make nullmailer-send reload its config files ("remotes" and
  "pausetime" each time it scans the queue).

- Fixed top-level install-root target to run chmod/chown on the right
  path to nullmailer-queue.

- Added a configure test for libinet, libsocket, and libxnet libraries
  for systems that have their networking code seperate from the main C
  library (such as Solaris).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.36

- Imported generic CLI library, to avoid the use of getopt on systems
  that don't have one.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.35

- Protocols now take a "-p #" to specify the port number to connect to.

- This option can be specified in the "remotes" file immediately after
  the protocol name.

- nullmailer-send will now only rescan the mail queue if its timestamp
  has changed since the last scan.

- Fixed an observed problem with empty domain names by using uname(2)
  instead of domainname and hostname.

- The header address parsing code is rewritten to do a lexical
  tokenization before parsing.

- Imported new fdbuf and mystring libraries

- Updated init scripts and RPM spec to work with new daemontools 0.61
  and supervise-scripts packages.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.33
- fixed a bug in the "list" template class that caused nullmailer-send
  to only send out one message before sleeping
- added a trivial address remapping facility to nullmailer-queue to
  allow local addresses to be redirected to a remote administrator
  address.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.32
- the address parser now deals properly with quoted addresses
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.31
- added a HOWTO document
- "make install-root" will now properly make nullmailer-queue setuid
  nullmail
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.30
- fixed bug in the I/O library that caused nullmailer-inject to return
  an error on messages with a single blank line following the header,
  even though the message was successfully sent to nullmailer-queue
- in nullmailer-inject, the hostname of the sender is set from the
  defaulthost config file instead of hostname() (note that default is
  set from hostname() if the file does not exist)
- fixed a bug in nullmailer-inject that would cause it to incorrectly
  clear its recipient list when using command-line recipients with a
  "resent" message
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.29
- included the testing framework (mostly empty) into the package
- fixed some bugs in nullmailer-inject caused by incorrect offsets into
  the array of header fields
- many bug fixes to the address parsing framework
- nullmailer-inject now has an option to only print out the message
  instead of passing it on to nullmailer-queue
- many sendmail flags are now ignored instead of causing errors in the
  sendmail front end to nullmailer-inject
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.28
- fixed the bugs in the spec and init script
- nullmailer-inject now handles the "c" flag like qmail-inject
- changed some error messages
- the sendmail front end should have its header vs command-line
  recipients logic fixed now
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.27
- added a QMQP protocol module
- fixed a missing NUL-termination when creating the Date header line
- nullmailer-inject now parses the NULLMAILER_FLAGS -- see the man page
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.26
- nullmailer-queue and nullmailer-send now go into sbin instead of bin
- bugfixes to the unique number generation routines
- moved some files around internally
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.25
- nullmailer-send now reads a protocol name along with the remote host
- nullmailer-inject now handles its command-line options properly, as
  well as reading and using defaulthost, defaultdomain, and idhost
- fixed several bugs in the address parsing and date-generation code
- revised the interface between nullmailer-send and the protocol modules
  to simplify the interface and nullmailer-send
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.22
- added simple sendmail front end
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
