  name and address from the command line properly.

- Modified the CLI library to behave more like the standard getopt
  library.

- Added some notes to the nullmailer-send manual page explaining how
  messages are delivered.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  when the optional "pausetime" configuration file did not exist.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.37

- Fixed bug in address parser that caused strings like "<a@b.c>"
  (without a leading comment) to fail.

- Make nullmailer-send rescan the mail queue each time it wakes up,
  rather than only if the timestamp changes to avoids race conditions.

- Make nullmailer-send reload its config files ("remotes" and
  "pausetime" each time it scans the queue).

- Fixed top-level install-root target to run chmod/chown on the right
  path to nullmailer-queue.

  for systems that have their networking code separate from the main C
  library (such as Solaris).

Changes in version 0.36

- Imported generic CLI library, to avoid the use of getopt on systems
  that don't have one.

  has changed since the last scan.

  instead of domainname and hostname.

  tokenization before parsing.

  an error on messages with a single blank line following the header,
  even though the message was successfully sent to nullmailer-queue
- in nullmailer-inject, the hostname of the sender is set from the
  defaulthost config file instead of hostname() (note that default is
  set from hostname() if the file does not exist)

  clear its recipient list when using command-line recipients with a
  "resent" message
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- fixed some bugs in nullmailer-inject caused by incorrect offsets into
  the array of header fields
- many bug fixes to the address parsing framework
- nullmailer-inject now has an option to only print out the message
