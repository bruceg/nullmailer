-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.00RC6

- Protocol modules now report all failure and success messages.

- Removed the whole gethostname/getdomainname mess and replaced it with
  code to read the hostname from the "me" control file, and the default
  domain name from the "defaultdomain" control file.

- Fixed a bug that would cause lines starting with a period to have that
  period stripped when it was sent via SMTP.

- Added some missing includes to fix compilation failures in various
  sources.

- Fixed a bug in the setenv function in sendmail.cc.

NOTE!  Make sure to set up the new "me" control file before using this
version.  The RPM install does this automatically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.00RC5

- Fixed getdomainname prototype in lib/hostname.cc.
- Return proper error codes for permanent and temporary SMTP failures.
- Adapted to use supervise-scripts 3.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.00RC4

- Fixed the reversed logic in the named pipe bug check.
- Updated the HOWTO notes.
- Fixed a compile problem on Solaris (and possibly other systems).
- Fixed address parsing to strip a trailing period in the domain name.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.00RC3

- Treat the first non-header line in a message as the first line of the
  body, even if it isn't preceded by a blank line.
- Fixed another host name bug causing compilation failures on systems
  without "domainname" in struct utsname.
- Fixed some typos that would prevent proper TCP connections on many
  systems.
- Handle systems that require both a reader and a writer on a named pipe
  to do a proper select.
- Added a man page for the sendmail emulator, and an overall man page.
- Fixed a bug in the fdbuf library that was causing data loss or damage.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.00RC2

- Fixed a bug in the way host names are determined.  This should fix
  problems with nullmailer-queue reporting an invalid envelope.

- Fixed a portability bug in the mergelib.sh script.

- Fixed a potential bug in the SMTP protocol response handling.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.00RC1

- Imported latest fdbuf, mystring, and cli libraries.

- Fixed a bug in the timezone handling on systems with tm_gmtoff.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.40

- Fixed some compile problems to allow nullmailer to compile on FreeBSD.

- Fixed a bug in the sendmail emulator to allow it to set the sender
  name and address from the command line properly.

- Modified the CLI library to behave more like the standard getopt
  library.

- Made a change to protocol between nullmailer-send and protocol
  modules.  nullmailer-send now opens up the message files and passes
  them to the protocol module as FD 0 instead of passing a filename.

- Added some notes to the nullmailer-send manual page explaining how
  messages are delivered.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.39

- Fixed problems in nullmailer-send in parsing the "remotes" file.  It
  previously did not handle comment lines or tabs or multiple white
  space.

- Made nullmailer-inject stricter about header lines to ensure that they
  comply with RFC822.

- Several minor updates to the libraries to bring them up to date.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.38

- Fixed bug in nullmailer-send that caused it to refuse to send mail
  when the optional "pausetime" configuration file did not exist.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.37

- Fixed bug in address parser that caused strings like "<a@b.c>"
  (without a leading comment) to fail.

- Make nullmailer-send rescan the mail queue each time it wakes up,
  rather than only if the timestamp changes to avoids race conditions.

- Make nullmailer-send reload its config files ("remotes" and
  "pausetime" each time it scans the queue).

- Fixed top-level install-root target to run chmod/chown on the right
  path to nullmailer-queue.

- Added a configure test for libinet, libsocket, and libxnet libraries
  for systems that have their networking code seperate from the main C
  library (such as Solaris).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.36

- Imported generic CLI library, to avoid the use of getopt on systems
  that don't have one.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.35

- Protocols now take a "-p #" to specify the port number to connect to.

- This option can be specified in the "remotes" file immediately after
  the protocol name.

- nullmailer-send will now only rescan the mail queue if its timestamp
  has changed since the last scan.

- Fixed an observed problem with empty domain names by using uname(2)
  instead of domainname and hostname.

- The header address parsing code is rewritten to do a lexical
  tokenization before parsing.

- Imported new fdbuf and mystring libraries

- Updated init scripts and RPM spec to work with new daemontools 0.61
  and supervise-scripts packages.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.33
- fixed a bug in the "list" template class that caused nullmailer-send
  to only send out one message before sleeping
- added a trivial address remapping facility to nullmailer-queue to
  allow local addresses to be redirected to a remote administrator
  address.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.32
- the address parser now deals properly with quoted addresses
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.31
- added a HOWTO document
- "make install-root" will now properly make nullmailer-queue setuid
  nullmail
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.30
- fixed bug in the I/O library that caused nullmailer-inject to return
  an error on messages with a single blank line following the header,
  even though the message was successfully sent to nullmailer-queue
- in nullmailer-inject, the hostname of the sender is set from the
  defaulthost config file instead of hostname() (note that default is
  set from hostname() if the file does not exist)
- fixed a bug in nullmailer-inject that would cause it to incorrectly
  clear its recipient list when using command-line recipients with a
  "resent" message
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.29
- included the testing framework (mostly empty) into the package
- fixed some bugs in nullmailer-inject caused by incorrect offsets into
  the array of header fields
- many bug fixes to the address parsing framework
- nullmailer-inject now has an option to only print out the message
  instead of passing it on to nullmailer-queue
- many sendmail flags are now ignored instead of causing errors in the
  sendmail front end to nullmailer-inject
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.28
- fixed the bugs in the spec and init script

- added a QMQP protocol module

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.25
- nullmailer-send now reads a protocol name along with the remote host
- nullmailer-inject now handles its command-line options properly, as
  well as reading and using defaulthost, defaultdomain, and idhost
- fixed several bugs in the address parsing and date-generation code
- revised the interface between nullmailer-send and the protocol modules
  to simplify the interface and nullmailer-send
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.22
- added simple sendmail front end
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
